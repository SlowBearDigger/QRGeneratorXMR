🐻 Monero PayQR Generator - Features List
🚀 Core Functionality (The "Universal" Engine)

    Universal QR Generation: No longer restricted to crypto. Generate QR codes for URLs, Plain Text, Wi-Fi credentials, or any string data.

    Smart Auto-Detect (Beta): Automatically recognizes cryptocurrency addresses (Monero, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.) upon pasting and switches the form context instantly.

    Real-Time Instant Preview: Zero-latency rendering. The QR code updates automatically as you type or adjust styles, using optimized debouncing for performance.

    Privacy-First Architecture: 100% Client-Side. No data is ever sent to a server. All generation happens locally in your browser using WebAssembly and JS.

🧾 Professional Invoice System (New!)

    Dynamic Invoicing: Create professional crypto invoices/receipts directly in the browser.

    Customizable Fields:

        Business Name & Logo.

        Invoice Number & Date.

        Dynamic Line Items: Add unlimited rows for items (Description + Price).

        Footer/Memo notes.

    Calculated Totals: Visual breakdown of amounts.

    High-Res Export: Download invoices as PDF (for printing) or PNG (for sharing online), generated via HTML5 Canvas.

    Embedded QR: The payment QR is automatically embedded and styled within the invoice layout.

🎨 Deep Customization & Branding

    Advanced Styling Engine:

        Patterns: Choose from Squares, Dots, Rounded, Classy, and Extra-rounded styles.

        Corners: Customize corner markers (Squares, Dots).

    Gradient Support: Full support for Linear and Radial gradients with customizable start/end colors.

    Logo Integration: Upload and embed your own logo (PNG/SVG) in the center of the QR code.

    Background Control: Custom background colors or transparent backgrounds for invoices.

    One-Click Randomizer: "Feel lucky" button to generate unique, aesthetically pleasing color combinations instantly.

    Visual Presets: Built-in themes (Monero Orange, Cyberpunk, Synthwave, Cypherpunk).

🛡️ Security & Safety Features

    Address Verification Mode: A dedicated "Verify Address" tool that forces a double-check comparison to prevent clipboard hijacking (clippers) or human error.

    Input Validation: Regex-based validation for supported cryptocurrencies to warn about malformed addresses.

    Disposable QRs: Optional "Self-destruct" mode where the QR blurs/vanishes from the screen after a set time (useful for POS terminals or temporary displays).

💻 Technical & UX Highlights

    PWA (Progressive Web App): Installable on mobile and desktop. Works offline.

    Responsive Design: Fully responsive interface that adapts from mobile screens to large desktop monitors.

    Interactive Background: Physics-based particle background on desktop (drifting/reactive dots).

    Export Formats: Download standalone QRs as .png, .svg, or .pdf.

    Social Sharing: One-click intent to share your tool on X (Twitter).
